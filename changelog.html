    <p> Created the website! I was inspired by all the various videos that had popped up on my feed along with my continued annoyance with social media. All of the platforms have soooo many ads and so little control now that I thought it would be fun to go back and join the people creating a personal web.</p>
    <p> My website will include a bunch of random things that I like and I'm hoping that the navigation of it will be reminicsent of the old Adventure Quest game. I want to add a bunch of random things like links to websites I like, mini-games, chatroom, a map of our MC world etc. Eventually I'd like to figure out how to add a server/database to allow people to save what they do on the website and make it a bit more of a persistent experience!</p>
    <p>There will also be some professional stuff like my resume. I'd love to learn some more about html,CSS, and JS which I think will both be fun and help me career wise. I'd like to find a way to seperate them out a bit so that if I use the website as my resume they can only see what I would want them to.</p>  
    <p>Lastly, while I am starting with having the site up on NeoCities I'd eventually like to host it myself on a spare computer I have. I'd like to use that computer to both host a website and a NAS with my music, movies, and random data.</p>

    <p>Added music check box to the main page. Want to change it to a bard playing when unmuted, sad when muted. Also would like to make it have several different songs?</p>
